          <h1>MATSUMOTO CASTLE</h1>
          <h2>the inner castle </h2>
          <p>
            Matsumoto Castle, also known as the “Crow Castle” for its striking black exterior, is one of Japan’s most
            iconic and well-preserved castles. Built in the 16th century, it features a unique wooden interior, stone
            foundations, and elegant defensive architecture. Surrounded by a picturesque moat and the backdrop of the
            Japanese Alps, the castle offers a glimpse into Japan’s feudal history and is a must-visit for history
            enthusiasts and photographers alike.
          <h2>mypersonal experience</h2>

          <p> Known as the “Crow Castle” because of its
            striking black walls, it immediately stood out against the backdrop of the blue sky. Seeing it in
            person felt surreal, it’s one of the oldest surviving castles in Japan, and you can sense that history the
            moment you approach it.
            Walking across the moat and looking up at the towers, I was struck by how imposing the structure
            is. Inside, the castle still has its original wooden interiors and steep staircases, which made exploring
           quite difficult. Each floor had something to discover, from weapon
            displays to views of the city and mountains through the narrow windows once used for defence.
            </p>
            <p>
            What I loved most was climbing all the way to the top floor. From there, the view of Matsumoto and
            the surrounding mountains was incredible it gave me a sense of how perfectly placed the castle is within its
            landscape. 
            Matsumoto Castle wasn’t just a sightseeing stop for me it was an experience of Japan’s history,
            architecture, and natural beauty all in one. Standing there, surrounded by so much history, I understood why
            it’s considered one of the country’s most treasured landmarks.
